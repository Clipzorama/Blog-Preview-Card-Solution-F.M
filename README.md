# Blog-Preview-Card-Solution-F.M
This repository contains my solution to the Frontend Mentor Blog Preview Card challenge. I used flexbox for layout, worked on improving my usage of the box-shadow property, and continued refining my responsive design skills. Future projects will focus on mobile-first workflow and creating highly adaptable, responsive websites.
