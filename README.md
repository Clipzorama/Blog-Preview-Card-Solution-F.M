## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

During this project, I deepened my understanding of the box-shadow property, which allowed me to create a stylish, elevated card with a distinct shadow effect. This solution was a bit easier than previous ones, but I still found room for improvement.

I also continued practicing media queries, although there wasnâ€™t much to adjust for smaller screens in this particular project. It helped me feel more confident in responsive design.

```html
<section class="all-content">
        <div class="card">
            <img class="top" src="./assets/images/illustration-article.svg" alt="Cool Picture here">
            <div class="label">Learning</div>
            <h5>Published 21 Dec 2023</h5>
            <h2>HTML & CSS foundations</h2>
            <p class="details">These languages are the backbone of every website, defining structure, content, and
                presentation.</p>
            <div class="signature">
                <img src="./assets/images/image-avatar.webp" alt="Greg" class="face">
                <p class="name">Greg Hooper</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </section>

```

```css

* {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}
body {
    background-color: var(--Yellow);
}
.all-content {
    height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}
.card {
    background-color: var(--White);
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    border-radius: 20px;
    width: 22%;
    border: 1px solid black;
    padding: 20px;
    box-shadow: 8px 8px 0 0 black;
    font-family: "Figtree";
}

```

### Continued development

Moving forward, I want to focus more on:

- Mobile First Workflow: Starting my designs with mobile layouts first and then progressively enhancing them for larger screens. This workflow will allow me to create more responsive websites that adapt well to all device sizes.

- Exploring more advanced CSS techniques like grid for layout or animations to make my components more interactive.
